# Overview
Bamazon is an Amazon-like storefront powered by Node and MySQL. For customers, the bamazon app takes in orders, calculates price, and depletes stock from the store's inventory.

For managers, the bamazon app views inventoryand and purchase as many products as they'd like (if they're in stock).
